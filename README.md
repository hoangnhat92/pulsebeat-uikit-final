# PulseBeat
**PulseBeat-UIKit** is a starter project that shows how to use dependency injection in a clean and practical way. It’s built with the MVVM-C pattern (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator). The Coordinator here is kept super simple to keep things focused on dependency injection. If you’re looking for a deeper dive into Coordinators, there are plenty of great articles out there to check out.

You can learn more about the project in this article.
